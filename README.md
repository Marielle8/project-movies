# Project Movies

The goal of this project was to learn how to build multi-page applications using React router.

## The problem

We started by discussing what to create as a page and what to create as a component for the first two pages (home and movie details). Once we finished the general requirements, we added more pages and components. As can be seen, we have a home page where we mount the popular list component. We used this structure with the black goal in mind to add a select menu on the home page which allows the user to toggle between different movie lists. If we had more time, we would add those lists and the select menu. We would also do the styling for mobile and tablet.

This is the codepen for CSS loader: https://codepen.io/mattbhenley/pen/gQgVxG
